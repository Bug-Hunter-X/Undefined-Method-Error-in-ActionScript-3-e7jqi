This repository contains an example of a common ActionScript 3 error: calling a possibly undefined method. The bug.as file demonstrates the error, and bugSolution.as provides a solution.  This is important because undefined method calls are a frequent cause of runtime errors in ActionScript 3 applications, often difficult to track down without careful debugging.  The solution highlights the importance of explicitly checking for the existence of properties and methods before accessing them.
